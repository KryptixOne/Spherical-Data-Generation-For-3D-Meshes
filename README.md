Dataset creation using the Acroynm Dataset and library.


Resulting Data is a spherical projection of the 3-D meshes.

The Data is organized as follows:

Channel 1: Spherical Depth Data, obtain through simple ray casting

Channel 2: Gripper Position Data, Mapped to nearest ray

Channel 3: Spherical Theta Value --> Used to obtain orientation of grasp

Channel 4: Spherical Phi Value --> Used to obtain orientation of grasp

Channel 5: Rotational Alpha Value --> Used to obtain grasp rotation
